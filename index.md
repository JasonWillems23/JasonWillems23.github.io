**JasonWillems23's ePortfolio**

**Professional Self-Assessment**

A.)  When I started this journey roughly three years ago, I had a very minimal sense of what I wanted out of the computer science program and no idea where it would take me.  As I progressed through the program coursework and was exposed to the different aspects of computer science, the areas in which I wanted to focus after graduation quickly became apparent.  What I hadnâ€™t yet understood was how integral the other aspects of computer science were to my overall success in school and beyond.  One project I worked on during my coursework that had a profound impact on me was during the Collaboration and Team Project course.  This course taught me the essential skills and knowledge regarding version control and how to manage local and centralized repositories using resources such as Bitbucket and Git Bash.  Throughout my coursework  I have also development a familiarity in using several different integrated development environments such as Eclipse, NetBeans, and PyCharm.  This has allowed me to create functional code using multiple programming languages like Java, C++ and Python.  Upon my completion of courses encompassing software design, data structures and algorithms, I learned the importance of creating modular and reusable code to maximize my efficiency as a programmer and how to apply practical testing and debugging methods to ensure proper functionality of a program.  The completion of this coursework has provided me with the competence, proficiency and know-how to initiate and implement revisions and enhancements to these artifacts from my coursework.  This firmly demonstrates my strengths and abilities which I will draw upon to quickly establish myself in a professional role within the world of computer science.

B.)  The following artifacts that I have chosen to include in my ePortfolio are a culmination of projects that have had a profound impact on me throughout my coursework and have ultimately become the primary focus for my future professional endeavors.  The concepts and applications for which the Java programming language can be used in the world of computer science, coupled with the importance of relational database management through skills within MySQL, have inspired me to pursue these aspects as my primary focal points as a computer science professional.  The first such artifact from the software engineering and design category was originally a C++ program that prompted a user for information regarding a bid, stored that information and displayed that same information with a different prompt via a menu.  I opted to convert this program from C++ into Java to showcase my knowledge and aptitude surrounding the concepts of Java and how they relate to other programming languages.  The next artifact, as it pertains to data structures and algorithms, is a C++ program that loads information from an external file and runs a selection sort algorithm based on information from the file.  I chose to enhance this artifact to demonstrate my comprehension of the concepts regarding data structures and algorithms, as well as, my capacity to incorporate additional functionality while maintaining the original integrity of the code.  The final enhancement included in the ePortfolio relates to a database artifact that uses MySQL to create, read, update and delete information that is included in a relational database.  This artifact was chosen to implement a more complex query that further expands upon the data within the database that uses more advanced methodologies of MySQL.  These artifacts were specifically chosen as a cohesive collection that represents my full range of knowledge, skills and abilities as they pertain to computer science.  

**Code Review:** 

[2-2 Milestone One Code Review](https://github.com/JasonWillems23/JasonWillems23.github.io/blob/master/2-2%20Milestone%20Code%20Review.mov)

**Enhancement One - Software Engineering/Design**

A.)  The artifact that I chose for the Software Design and Engineering category is called Lab 1-3 from my Data Structures and Algorithms class.  This particular program was used to help us learn out to create variables to be placed inside of a data structure and how to access and display that stored information through input prompts.  

B.)  I chose to include this particular artifact and convert it into another language because I have been exposed to multiple different programming languages throughout my coursework and I thought a great way to test my knowledge and show my problem solving skills would be to convert the program from C++ to Java.  By recreating this in another programming language, the artifact was improved by giving it more accessibility and giving others the ability to run the code on multiple platforms. 

C.)  I believe that I have met the course objectives for this artifact and have achieved the functionality that I set out to create upon converting this program from C++ to Java.  With some much appreciated guidance I was able to recreate a program that behaves in a very similar way to the original artifact using the concepts of the Java programming language.    	

D.)  I learned how to apply and implement some of the concepts of C++  and recreate them into Java.
	Some of the elements were not as simple as rewriting them in another language, I had to learn how each concept worked and how each language utilizes that concept in their language.  Some concepts diverged to a point that caused confusion and lead to mistakes.

**Enhancement Two - Algorithms and Data Structures**

A.)  The artifact I chose for the Algorithms and Data Structures category is called VectorSorting.  This is a program that I worked on in June of 2019 as part of the coursework for my Data Structures and Algorithm class.  This artifact is a C++ program that uses a data structure to store information from an external parser file and implements a sort logic algorithm that allows the user to implement a quick sort or selection sort of the file.

B.)  I selected this artifact to be included in my ePortfolio because I believe that it will showcase my understanding regarding Algorithms and Data Structures, as well as, my ability to add practical functionality to an existing program.  The enhancements that I want to include in this artifact will improve the code by providing more pragmatic and effective functionality that will expand the current usability of the program. Successfully implementing my planned enhancements will exhibit a fundamental comprehension that encompasses the concepts of data structure and algorithm creation and execution.

C.)  I believe that I was able to add the functionality that I set out to create in my enhancement plan for this artifact.  It was a struggle at first to get the original program to run in my environment, but once that was accomplished, I was able to implement the new variables and functions into the code that provided the planned enhancements from Module One.    Working on this artifact has given me new insight on using the principles of algorithms and data structures and the ability to use the knowledge I have gained to design and create new possibilities within existing programs. 	

D.)  I feel that one major challenge that I faced when implementing the enhancements was to ensure that the new functionality that I was adding to the program did not interfere with its current state and allowed the program to function as expected.  The primary goal was to seamlessly integrate the enhancements that I am implementing into the program.  With this in mind, I was able to focus on each function within the code and I learned quite a lot about how declared variables are used as parameters and how they are called into different functions throughout the program. I also learned how to add to a data structure that is used to read information from an external file.  The overall experience has shed new light on what it takes to work with code that has already been created and has instilled new confidence in my potential abilities as a future coder.

**Enhancement Three - Databases**

A.)  The artifact that I have chosen to enhance for the Databases category is the final project that I completed in December of 2018 for my Introduction to SQL course.  This artifact uses MySQL commands to create, read, update and delete information within a database and also displays that information based on specific and customizable queries. 

B.)  I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because MySQL is an area of Computer Science that I want to pursue when I finish with my degree program.  By enhancing this artifact with more complex queries, I will be able to showcase my comprehension of the fundamental aspects of using SQL to manage and manipulate sensitive information located within any database.  Successfully implementing more sophisticated query commands will give the artifact increased customizability that can be adopted to utilize the data in more meaningful ways.  

C.)  I do believe that I have met the objectives that I have set out to accomplish in my enhancement plan.  I have implemented a more complex query for added functionality that allows the data to be tailored to the needs of those who need to access it.  Additionally, I added a command to back up the entire database to a separate disk drive, as well as, a second command that only backs up the changes since the previous backup.  Both of which add an extremely important layer of redundancy to the database in the event of data loss.  

D.)  One of the major challenges that I faced while creating the enhancements for this artifact was the length of time that has gone by since I last used the concepts regarding relational database management.  As I was refamiliarizing myself and executing the enhancements, my desire to pursue MySQL in a professional capacity was reinforced and I became excited to start the process of drastically improving my proficiency of MySQL and database management post-graduation.
